@unpublished{Zhu2004,
abstract = {Detection problems are beginning to attract the attention of statisticians (e.g., Bolton and Hand 2002). When evaluating and comparing different detection algorithms, the concepts of recall, precision and average precision are often used, but many statisticians, especially graduate students and research assistants doing the “dirty work,” are not familiar with them. In this article, we take a systematic and slightly more formal approach to review these concepts for the larger statistics community, but the technical level of this presentation remains elementary.},
